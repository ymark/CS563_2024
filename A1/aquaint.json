With this new technology  doctors are able to removal cancerous tissues embedded deep inside the brain or near sensitive organs that makes normal surgery very difficult and risky. With radio surgery  every step is controlled by computers and patients are  conscious   while they undergo treatment.   This new technique is also capable of treating diseases such as Artero Venous  Malformation    the  clotting   of veins or blood  capillaries  in the brain .So far  ninety per cent of the radio surgery treatments have been successful and patients only have to remain in hospital for three days.

In March  former President  Le Duc Anh    in an article for the Army newspaper  criticized irregularities in the bidding process for the country s largest thermal electric plant.   Local media have reported that the company has overblown the costs for construction and repair work on a number of projects to justify overcharging for electricity.   Vietnam is chronically short of power  and several projects to raise its output are bogged down in bureaucracy.   EVN imposed  rotating power cuts   earlier this year as the worst  drought   in a century dropped water levels to critical levels at the  reservoir  s that feed key  hydroelectric  plants.",

The goal is to make it easier to travel by train to Lufthansa s  main hub   in  Frankfurt    instead of flying there. Starting in 2001  Lufthansa boss Juergen Weber hopes to eliminate such short hops   between Frankfurt and  Cologne    for example   thus freeing up takeoff and  landing slots   for more lucrative international flights.   As part of the Lufthansa  Deutsche Bahn   deal  passengers could check their luggage through at the train station for the Lufthansa flight they will catch at Frankfurt.   The service is already in place at Saarbruecken  although travelers must drop their bags off the day before. Starting in September  the service will be extended to five other cities  Duesseldorf  Cologne   Bonn     Wuerzburg   and Nuremberg.   Passengers flying on Lufthansa partners  United   and  SAS  would also be able to use the service  he said.   The airline and railway said they d form a working group to resolve such problems as security checks on the luggage and making sure the bags get to the airport from the train station on time.   Deutsche Bahn chief Johannes Ludewig said his railway also would work to coordinate schedules better with Lufthansa flights to make connections easier  and allow for combined train and plane tickets.  pfg aet",

The case gave Japan another shock two weeks after  curry   laced with  cyanide   and  arsenic   killed four people at a festival in southwestern Japan. It also raised fears of  copycat   attacks.   Lab tests on the tea revealed traces of  sodium azide    a chemical used in many industrial products  including  air bag   mechanisms  said police spokesman Masashi Toma.   The victims of the poisoning were in stable condition  but three suffered mild  liver disorders   Tuesday  said Yasuo Hirose  an official at the  Niigata City   Hospital.

He said details would be disclosed later.   The painting valued at up to U.S. dlrs 1 million was stolen Aug. 9 by a man armed with a  shotgun   in a daring robbery at the  Auckland   Art Gallery.   The man  clad in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet  dark visor and gloves  burst through the main door with a sawed off shotgun and a  crowbar  .   Museum official Kate Darrow said the man ran through the Grey Gallery waving a  firearm   and yelling  get down    and  keep back   to staff and patrons.   She said the man appeared to know where he was going and went to the Lower Wellesley Gallery  where the painting was displayed.   The gunman grabbed the painting off the wall and dropped it on the ground. He then used the crowbar to remove the canvas from the frame and take it off the backing board.   The robber left through the main entrance and skirted behind the gallery into  Albert Park   pursued by a member of the public. He was believed to have climbed on a motorcycle and escaped via a nearby highway.",

The criminal environment has changed at a  much greater pace   than Interpol  Toshinori Kanemoto told the opening session of the 67th general assembly of the International Criminal Police Organization.   A failure to modernize Interpol could mean the organization  risks being displaced against a backdrop of international  organized crime      he said.   Kanemoto said a new Interpol strategy will be discussed at the six day assembly and  if adopted  would be put into effect next January.   The former Japanese police official said the assembly also will discuss  terrorism    which he called one of the  new forms of criminality    as well as the  illegal drug trade   and  money laundering  .   With crime becoming increasingly sophisticated  Kanemoto said  it has become harder for police officials to gather  evidence   for prosecution. He said these new challenges require increased cooperation  particularly through Interpol.   The police officials are expected to discuss a  strategic development plan  aimed at making Interpol more proactive by re examining the needs of the group s 177 member states  Kanemoto said.

But  environmental campaigners   criticized the lack of a timeframe for closing the country s  four nuclear power plants  .   Government officials will work with representatives of the  power industry    environmental groups and local governments to discuss a timetable and removal of  nuclear waste    a government statement said. It is unrealistic to build more  power stations   because of environmental concerns  the government has said.   Should the discussions between concerned parties fail to produce an agreed timetable  the federal  cabinet   will make the decision  said the statement.    We have set out on a new course    said Federal Energy Minister  Moritz Leuenberger  .  Details have yet to be decided.     In a related move  the federal cabinet ordered energy officials to draw up a discussion paper on changing laws governing the domestic  electricity   market.   The government envisages the creation of a national company to own the power  infrastructure  .   A timeframe for carrying out  liberalization   of the electricity market itself remains to be determined  the cabinet said.   The cabinet said it wants to support hydroelectric plants. It ordered a study of the possibility of  tax breaks  for hydroelectric plants and how to encourage upgrades of those plants.",

The ANC  which led the struggle against  white rule   and now is in power  previously has acknowledged it was told to expect implication in right violations.   The  Truth and Reconciliation Commission   will release its final report on 2 1 2 years of investigation on Thursday. The report was expected to place overwhelming blame for the era s abuses on white governments and their brutal security services.    South African Broadcasting Corp.   radio said it had been leaked a  preliminary document   which condemns the ANC as politically and morally responsible for gross human rights violations during and after the fall of apartheid.   An ANC spokesman  Thabo Masebe  said he believed the news report referred to a commission letter sent in advance  informing us of its intention to implicate the ANC in gross human rights violations.     Commission officials could not immediately be reached for comment.   The ANC was nervous enough about the report to request a meeting with  commissioners   earlier this month. The panel refused  to avoid appearing embarrassed.   The party says the accusations against it likely would center on the planting of  land mines   on border farms  abuses at its military camps in  Angola  and bombings.    djw",

The 51 percent  state owned company   notified the  Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate   of plans to build the plant  to be called HydroKraft  pending approval by government agencies.   The company said if it receives the proper approvals in 1999  construction of the plant would be completed during 2002 and production startup would occur in early 2003.   Earlier this year  the company announced a new technology that would allow it to use clean burning hydrogen to generate electricity. The hydrogen for the plant would be extracted from  natural gas  .   Norsk Hydro  a major  petroleum   producer  now says studies have shown the proposal to be economically viable. It also said the plant s  carbon dioxide   emissions would be 90 percent lower than plants using natural gas.    Norway   is the world s second largest oil exporter  and also produces vast amounts of natural gas from its offshore fields. Virtually all of the country s electricity now comes from  hydroelectric plants  .   Under the company s plans  natural gas  air and water would be mixed to produce hydrogen   nitrogen   and carbon dioxide.   Norsk Hydro wants to build the plant at Karmoey  an island about 500 kilometers  300 miles  west of  Oslo .",

Dracula   was named after the  Transylvania  n  vampire   count of legend because of his bloody appetite  said Onetiu.

Dracula has killed at least six cows and seven sheep over the past six weeks.   Most bears are  omnivorous    but in Romania  many bears were  weaned   on meat  said Onetiu.  Nicolae Ceausescu    the  communist    dictator   toppled and executed almost a decade ago  was an avid hunter  and hunting reserve cubs were fed meat to make them grow bigger quicker  leaving generations partial to meat.

Botha   would be put on trial for abuses committed during  white rule  .   Prosecutor Jan D Oliveira said he currently has insufficient evidence to prosecute Botha  but that information collected by the  Truth and Reconciliation Commission  South Africa     which investigated apartheid era abuses  still must be evaluated to ascertain whether charges would ultimately be brought.   Last month  the Truth Comission issued a landmark report on its findings. It said Botha had ordered the 1987 bombing of the  African National Congress    London headquarters and the 1988 bombing of a  Johannesburg   building housing an anti apartheid group.   When Botha was head of state in the 1980s  thousands of people were detained without trial. Many were tortured and others killed.   The commission can grant  amnesty   to those who fully confess to politically motivated abuses committed during apartheid. Botha has said he has nothing to confess and has not sought amnesty.   Earlier this year  Botha was convicted of  contempt of court   for refusing to testify before the commission. He was handed a suspended one year jail sentence and a 10 000  rand   dlrs 5 700  fine.

Water supply   on the southwest European peninsula was one of the few sticking points between the two countries  which have strong trade links and close political ties.   Spanish plans to develop  hydroelectric   projects on its side of the border have been a constant threat to Portugal s supply  which comes mainly from rivers with sources in the neighboring country.   Both governments also reiterated their decision jointly to campaign for continued development funds provided by wealthier  European Union   nations.   Cabinet Members also agreed to build new road and railway links between the two countries.

Zoo director Hubert Luecker said the complaint was filed with an administrative court in  Cologne  .   The elephants  which were to be sent this month to the Dresden and  Erfurt   zoos in eastern  Germany    were part of a group of 30 young elephants captured in August from herds in  Botswana   and taken to a  South African   farm.   A South African judge ruled early this month that the animals had been abused and deprived of water at the farm. He granted temporary custody to the  National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals  .   But while the judge approved the export of four baby elephants to Germany and three to  Switzerland    Trittin last week said Germany would protest the abuse of animals by not accepting them in its zoos.   Others argue the elephants may face a worse fate if they don t come to Germany.   Norbert Otto  a federal lawmaker from Erfurt  demanded in  parliament   Tuesday that Trittin take steps to prevent the animals from being  put to sleep   in South Africa.   In addition  the cultural minister of  Saxony   of which Dresden is the capital  asked the state s 740 000 school children to write letters of protest urging Tritten to allow the elephants into Germany.  aet pfg",

Sotheby s first major  online auction    planned for July  will feature  baseball   memorabilia.   While online auction sites have become extremely popular  consumer groups say the sites have produced more consumer complaints than any other Internet category because of shoddy merchandise and other fraud.   Sotheby s said it would only sell merchandise from the auction house itself or reputable art dealers.

The objects will be flown to Italy this week  along with pieces that were loaned to the museum for an  antiquities   exhibit  according to a statement issued by the Getty on Monday.   The stolen items are a terra cotta drinking cup from 480  B.C.    found to have been illegally  excavated   from an  archaeological site    a  torso   of the god  Mithras   from the  2nd century    found to have been stolen from a private Italian collection  and the sculpted head of a victorious athlete  a 2nd century  Roman   copy of an earlier  Greek   work  which was apparently taken from the storeroom of a scientific excavation.

The  Space Telescope Science Institute   announced today that the  Hubble Space Telescope   on April 27 spotted an immense  Martian   storm cloud  made up of water  ice    that was 1 100 miles long and 900 wide.   Bands of clouds spiraled in a counterclockwise motion around a 200 mile wide eye in the center of the storm  taking on a shape that resembled  hurricanes   on  Earth    astronomers said.   The storm occurred during the summer in Mars  northern hemisphere. It came after seasonal warming  evaporated   the  carbon dioxide    ice sheet   that caps the  Martian north pole   during part of the year.   Officials said the storm was three times larger than a storm spotted 20 years ago by the  Viking Orbiter   spacecraft.   Astronomers used a  wide field planetary camera   on Hubble to photograph Mars during the planet s closest approach to Earth in nearly eight years.   Two pictures  taken six hours apart on April 27  showed that the storm moved slightly eastward. In the second picture  the storm appeared to be in the process of breaking up.   Later pictures by the Hubble camera failed to find the storm  and astronomers said it could have been a short lived  phenomenon .",

Kenneth Cates  53  was found Wednesday morning on a horse trail in a heavily wooded area of the  Kenai National Wildlife Refuge   near his hometown of  Soldotna  .   The attack happened about six miles off a busy road. The area is about 60 miles southwest of Anchorage.   The fatal mauling is thought to have happened Tuesday.   His only visible wound was a single bite to the head  said Bruce Bartley  a spokesman for the state Division of Wildlife Conservation.   State and federal wildlife officials were looking for the bear involved in the attack. If the bear is judged to pose a continuing threat to humans it may be killed.   Troopers said Cates  .280 caliber  rifle   and two spent shell casings were found near the body  along with traces of blood that suggest that Cates may have wounded the animal.    We don t know if one was a warning shot and one real  or if there were two real shots    Bartley said.   Cates  death is the first fatal bear mauling in Alaska since Feb. 8  1998  when  Audelio Luis Cortes    40  was killed while working on a  seismic   crew in the  Swanson River    oil field   near  Kenai .
